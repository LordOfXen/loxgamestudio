					<span>Lox Game Studios</span>
					Lox Game Studios was firstly found in Turkey, Hatay. Even though most of the official work is being done in Washington and California, we currently have 44 employees from many countries such as Turkey, Russia, Sweden, United States, Germany and more without any restrictions about workplace since we prefer working with special cooperation softwares within the studio itself.
